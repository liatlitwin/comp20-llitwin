This repository is for Ming Chows Web Programming (COMP20) course at Tufts University, Spring 2014

My favorite project was assignment 1, a personal portfolio. It was exciting to design a personal webpage using the CSS/HTML5 that we had learned in just the first 2 weeks of lecture. I look forward to building onto this site as I continue work in web development.

I'm most proud of assignment 4, "2048-gamecenter". While it was challenging to get a hang of server-side web applications, it was overall pretty cool that I created an app that holds all scores a user plays of the addicting game 2048. 

I learned A LOT this semester. I came into this class thinking it would be a fun and useful elective for my last semester in college. It quickly became my favorite coure, as I realized all the cool things that can be done on the web. I learned how to use chrome dev tools, look at and understand source code, documentation, and the basics of server-side software like node.js. ALso, in working on the semester group project, it's been really cool to research different front-end frameworks and then utilize them.
